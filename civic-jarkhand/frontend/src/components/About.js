      <h1>About CivicTracker</h1>
      <p>CivicTracker is an innovative platform designed to empower citizens to report local civic issues efficiently. Our goal is to bridge the communication gap between residents and local authorities, facilitating quicker resolution of community problems such as potholes, broken streetlights, waste management, and more.</p>
      <p>Through our user-friendly interface, citizens can submit detailed reports, including location, descriptions, and photographic evidence. These reports are then routed to the relevant municipal departments or designated workers for action. We believe that an informed and engaged citizenry is key to building better, more responsive communities.</p>
      <p>Join us in making our cities cleaner, safer, and more efficient for everyone!</p>
